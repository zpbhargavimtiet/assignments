//The output shows that both the original byte value and the converted long 
//value are 56 because the value itself does not change during the conversion.
//the long value is the same as the byte value because the process of 
//widening conversion in Java does not alter the numeric value, 
	//it only changes the amount of memory allocated to store the value.
